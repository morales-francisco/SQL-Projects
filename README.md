# SQL Projects

In this section you will find the different projects in which I have been working with SQL.

To perform the different queries I have used Microsoft SQL Server.

The projects I have been working on so far are the following:
- [Exploratory Data Analysis - Maven Toys](https://github.com/morales-francisco/SQL-Projects/tree/main/ToysMaven).
- [Data Cleaning - Google Play Store](https://github.com/morales-francisco/SQL-Projects/tree/main/GooglePlayStore).
- [Creating a procedure and extracting data for visualizations - COVID19](https://github.com/morales-francisco/SQL-Projects/tree/main/COVID19).
