# SQL Projects

In this section you will find the different projects in which I have been using SQL as a tool.

To perform the different queries I have used Microsoft SQL Server.

The projects I have been working on so far are the following:
- [Exploratory data analysis - Toys Maven]().
- [Data cleaning - Google Play Store]().
- [Creating a procedure and extracting data for visualizations - COVID19]().
