# SQL Projects

You can find the various projects that I have worked on using SQL in this section. 

I've used Microsoft SQL Server to run the various queries. 

I have been working on the following projects thus far:
- [Exploratory Data Analysis - Maven Toys](https://github.com/morales-francisco/SQL-Projects/tree/main/ToysMaven).
- [Data Cleaning - Google Play Store](https://github.com/morales-francisco/SQL-Projects/tree/main/GooglePlayStore).
- [Creating a procedure and extracting data for visualizations - COVID19](https://github.com/morales-francisco/SQL-Projects/tree/main/COVID19).
